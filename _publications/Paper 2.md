## Abstract

The modification of polymeric biomolecules to achieve improved cementation is important for their potential
applications. This study presents the rheological behaviors of eco-friendly zein biopolymer and stiffness char足
acteristics of biopolymer-treated soil under various solvent and curing conditions. The rheological and stiffness
characteristics of zein biopolymer are evaluated in terms of shear stress, viscosity, and shear wave velocity. The
time sensitivity, flow index, and microstructure of biopolymer gel are analyzed. The biopolymer gel generally
exhibits a weakly non-Newtonian shear-thickening behavior, except for the specimen cured for 24 h under
chamber condition. At a constant shear rate, the biopolymer gel shows a rheopexy behavior, which is charac足
terized by an increase in viscosity over time. The shear wave velocity of biopolymer-treated soil increases with
the curing period, up to 50 and 96 % under atmospheric and chamber conditions, respectively. The peak ab足
sorption values for the hydroxyl functional group decrease significantly as the curing period and ethanol content
increase. Furthermore, the microparticle sizes of the zein biopolymer gel decrease with increasing ethanol
content. Therefore, understanding the stiffness characteristics of biopolymer-treated soil specimens for potential
soil stabilization can be improved based on the rheological properties of zein biopolymer.
