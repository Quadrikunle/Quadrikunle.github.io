## Abstract

The curing condition and solvent composition of biopolymer binders may impact their
efﬁcacy for soil stabilization. This study introduces a novel hydrophobic biopolymer, zein, and
investigates the effects of solvent and curing conditions on the mechanical properties of zein-treated
soils. The zein biopolymer is used to prepare cohesionless soil with various ethanol contents.
Unconﬁned compressive strength and microscopic tests are used to investigate the treated specimens
under two different curing conditions. The mechanical properties of the treated specimens are
evaluated in terms of compressive strength and the secant elastic modulus. The experimental results
show that the compressive strength and elastic modulus increase with the curing period under both
curing conditions. Higher curing temperature improves the compressive strength of biopolymer-
treated specimens. The linear relationship between compressive strength and the elastic modulus of
zein-treated soils shows higher strength and a lower elastic modulus compared to rock. Furthermore,
the zein biopolymer shows signiﬁcant strength improvement compared to the existing biopolymers,
including casein and lignin. Thus, the effects of solvent and curing conditions on the mechanical
properties of zein-treated soil should be considered for its application to soil stabilization.
