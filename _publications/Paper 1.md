## Abstract

The characterization and analysis of the cementation properties of novel biopolymer
binders in soils are essential for their potential application in geotechnical engineering. This study
investigates the cementation effect of a novel zein biopolymer binder on sandy soils. Soil specimens
are mixed with various contents of zein biopolymer ranging from 0 to 5%. The mechanical and
microscopic characteristics of the treated specimens are evaluated using unconﬁned compression tests
and scanning electron microscopy, respectively, after curing for 3, 7, and 28 days. The results show
a consistent increase in compressive strength and elastic modulus of treated soils with increasing
curing periods and biopolymer contents. A small amount (1%) of zein biopolymer increases soil
strength and elasticity regardless of gradation. Additionally, the bonding force between the soil–zein
biopolymer increases linearly with soil uniformity. Therefore, the application of zein biopolymer
can be potentially used as a binder for ﬁne- and coarse-grained soils in geotechnical engineering
considering its stabilization and sustainability properties.
