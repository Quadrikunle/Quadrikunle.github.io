## About the Conference

I am delighted to attend the Geo Congress 2023, held in Los Angeles, California, from March 26 to 29th, 2023. Geo-Congress is an annual conference organized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Geo-Institute. Geo-Congress was established in October 1996 by the ASCE to promote the geotechnical profession and enhance career development through specialty. The Geo-congress is an esteemed international conference focused on the advancements and challenges in geotechnical engineering. The congress served as a platform for engineers, researchers, academics, and industry professionals to exchange knowledge, share insights, and foster collaborations. I was opportune to engage in this year's congress to broaden my geotechnical knowledge and stay updated on the latest industry trends.

The Geo-Congress 2023 focused on exploring and promoting sustainable practices in geotechnical engineering, emphasizing the need for environmentally friendly infrastructural development. Geo Congress 2023 witnessed a remarkable turnout, with over 1200 professional participants. Short courses, a multitude of impactful presentations, keynote speeches, and technical sessions were held to exchange ideas and discuss research findings. The attendees engaged in discussions and presentations that addressed the challenges of ensuring long-term sustainability in geotechnical structures and fostered the exchange of ideas and innovative solutions to create a more sustainable future. Participants were allowed to enhance their knowledge and skills through four intensive short courses. These courses covered specialized topics and provided in-depth training, allowing attendees to expand their expertise in specific areas of geoengineering.

Geo Congress 2023 featured keynote lectures delivered by four esteemed and erudite professors. These highly respected experts in the field of geoengineering shared their invaluable insights, expertise, and research findings with the conference attendees. The conference featured a comprehensive program comprising over 1000 technical presentations. Also, the technical presentations were organized into six distinct categories, allowing attendees to choose specific areas of interest.

## Conference activities:
I participated in four keynote lectures that covered a wide range of topics in geotechnical engineering. These lectures provided valuable findings and recommendations that are pertinent to the field. The keynote lectures at Geo Congress 2023 provided valuable insights and recommendations for geotechnical engineering practices. The findings show the importance of accurate data interpretation, risk-informed decision-making, compatibility considerations, and comprehensive soil characterization in optimizing geotechnical designs, ensuring project safety, and enhancing overall performance. The knowledge gained from these lectures will undoubtedly contribute to my professional practice and commitment to excellence in geotechnical engineering.

Afterward, I was drawn to the fascinating posters displayed throughout the conference hall. Among the several captivating topics, two presentations caught my attention. The posters further enriched my knowledge, while interactions with presenters opened doors to insightful discussions. Notably, Joon Soon Park's research on the influence of mud dauber wasps on soil boi cementation and Daniel Adeleke's study on solute diffusion through bentonite-polymer composites captured my attention, highlighting the significance of natural elements in soil stabilization and containment applications. During the event, I had the wonderful opportunity to meet and connect with fellow geotechnical enthusiasts from around the globe. Engaging in conversations and idea-sharing with professors and researchers enriched my experience and broadened my perspective. Additionally, I had the honor of meeting the Geo-Institute director, who graciously presented me with a thoughtful gift, symbolizing the mutual exchange of knowledge and appreciation.

The Geo Congress 2023 concluded with two special reports by esteemed experts. Laurie Leshin, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She shared groundbreaking insights into Mars soil testing, revealing unique geotechnical properties. David Frost, a distinguished geotechnical engineer, led a team to investigate the devastating incident in the Turkey-Syria earthquake. Committee members summarized key findings and recommendations, inspiring innovation in geotechnical engineering. Their report shed light on the intricate factors contributing to the seismic event and offered valuable recommendations to mitigate similar scenarios in the future. The dedication of the geotechnical engineering team showcased their commitment to enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure in earthquake-prone regions. These experiences inspired and equipped me with a deeper understanding of sustainable geotechnical engineering practices
